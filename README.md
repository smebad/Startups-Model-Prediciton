# Startups Profit Prediction Using Linear Regression

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the profit of startups based on their investments in R&D, Administration, and Marketing. Using the **50 Startups Dataset**, we develop a **Linear Regression** model to estimate the profit and evaluate the model's performance.

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore the relationship between different features (R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend) and the target variable (Profit). The project is structured to guide you through:
1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset.
2. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preparing data for the model.
3. **Model Building**: Implementing Linear Regression to make predictions.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using various metrics.
5. **Conclusion**: Summarizing the key findings and outcomes of the analysis.

### Key Steps:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation matrix visualization
- Splitting data into training and test sets
- Training and testing a Linear Regression model
- Evaluating the model using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² score
- Saving the trained model for future use

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found [here on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/farhanmd29/50-startups). The dataset contains 50 observations of different startups and their investments in R&D, Administration, and Marketing, along with the profit they generated.

### Features:
- **R&D Spend**: Money spent on research and development.
- **Administration**: Money spent on administration tasks.
- **Marketing Spend**: Money spent on marketing.
- **State**: The state where the startup is based.
- **Profit**: The target variable (profit of the startup).
