# Startups-Model-Prediciton
In this notebook, we aim to predict the profit of startup companies based on their investments in different departments like R&amp;D, Administration, and Marketing. The dataset contains 50 observations of startups, and we will use Linear Regression to model the relationship between features and the target variable (Profit).
